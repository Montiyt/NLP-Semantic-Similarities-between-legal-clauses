            "0  BACKGROUND. This document contains final regulations regarding the proposed amendments to 26 CFR part 1 under section 860E of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations provide the circumstances under which a transferor of a noneconomic REMIC residual interest meeting the investigation and representation requirements may avail itself of the safe harbor by satisfying either the formula test or the asset test. Final regulations governing REMICs, issued in 1992, contain rules governing the transfer of noneconomic REMIC residual interests. In general, a transfer of a noneconomic residual interest is disregarded for all tax purposes if a significant purpose of the transfer is to enable the transferor to impede the assessment or collection of tax. A purpose to impede the assessment or collection of tax (a wrongful purpose) exists if the transferor, at the time of the transfer, either knew or should have known that the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on its share of the REMIC's taxable income. Under a safe harbor, the transferor of a REMIC noneconomic residual interest is presumed not to have a wrongful purpose if two requirements are satisfied: (1) the transferor conducts a reasonable investigation of the transferee's financial condition (the investigation requirement); and (2) the transferor secures a representation from the transferee to the effect that the transferee understands the tax obligations associated with holding a residual interest and intends to pay those taxes (the representation requirement). The IRS and Treasury have been concerned that some transferors of noneconomic residual interests claim they satisfy the safe harbor even in situations where the economics of the transfer clearly indicate the transferee is unwilling or unable to pay the tax associated with holding the interest. For this reason, on February 7, 2000, the IRS published in the Federal Register (65 FR 5807) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-100276-97; REG-122450-98) designed to clarify the safe harbor by adding the \"formula test,\" an economic test. The proposed regulation provides that the safe harbor is unavailable unless the present value of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the residual interest does not exceed the sum of: (1) The present value of any consideration given to the transferee to acquire the interest; (2) the present value of the expected future distributions on the interest; and (3) the present value of the anticipated t...  background\n",

            "0  Arbitration. Disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement that are not resolved pursuant to Section 5.1, including requests for specific performance, will be resolved through binding arbitration conducted pursuant to the rules of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and will occur in Geneva, Switzerland, unless another location is mutually agreed upon by Registry Operator and ICANN. Any arbitration will be in front of a single arbitrator, unless (i) ICANN is seeking punitive or exemplary damages, or operational sanctions, (ii) the parties agree in writing to a greater number of arbitrators, or (iii) the dispute arises under Section 7.6 or 7.7. In the case of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) in the preceding sentence, the arbitration will be in front of three arbitrators with each party selecting one arbitrator and the two selected arbitrators selecting the third arbitrator. In order to expedite the arbitration and limit its cost, the arbitrator(s) shall establish page limits for the parties’ filings in conjunction with the arbitration, and should the arbitrator(s) determine that a hearing is necessary, the hearing shall be limited to one (1) calendar day, provided that in any arbitration in which ICANN is seeking punitive or exemplary damages, or operational sanctions, the hearing may be extended for one (1) additional calendar day if agreed upon by the parties or ordered by the arbitrator(s) based on the arbitrator(s) independent determination or the reasonable request of one of the parties thereto. The prevailing party in the arbitration will have the right to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, which the arbitrator(s) shall include in the awards. In the event the arbitrators determine that Registry Operator has been repeatedly and willfully in fundamental and material breach of its obligations set forth in Article 2, Article 6 or Section 5.4 of this Agreement, ICANN may request the arbitrators award punitive or exemplary damages, or operational sanctions (including without limitation an order temporarily restricting Registry Operator’s right to sell new registrations). Each party shall treat information received from the other party pursuant to the arbitration that is appropriately marked as confidential (as required by Section 7.15) as Confidential Information of such other party in accordance with Section 7.15.

The Note Holders hereby appoint the Lead Securitization Note Holder as their agent, and grant to the Lead Securitization Note Holder an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest, and their proxy, for the purpose of exercising any and all rights and taking any and all actions available to the Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder in connection with any case by or against the Mortgage Loan Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code or in any other Insolvency Proceeding, including, without limitation, the right to file and/or prosecute any claim, vote to accept or reject a plan, to make any election under Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Mortgage Loan, and to file a motion to modify, lift or terminate the automatic stay with respect to the Mortgage Loan. The Note Holders hereby agree that, upon the request of the Lead Securitization Note Holder, the Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Lead Securitization Note Holder all and every such further deeds, conveyances and instruments as the Lead Securitization Note Holder may reasonably request for the better assuring and evidencing of the foregoing appointment and grant. All actions taken by the Servicer in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding are subject to and must be in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  bankruptcy\n",

In the event of any controversy, dispute or claim between the parties under, arising out of or related to this Agreement (including but not limited to, claims relating to breach, termination of this Agreement, or the performance of a party under this Agreement) whether based on contract, tort, statute or other legal theory (collectively referred to hereinafter as “Disputes”), the parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedures set forth below. The parties shall first attempt to resolve a dispute, at the written request of either party, through discussions between the Executive and an authorized senior management representative of the Company. If a dispute is not resolved by the foregoing discussions between the senior management of the Company and the Executive within thirty (30) days, the parties agree, at the written request of either party, to submit the dispute to a sole mediator selected by the parties for settlement within an additional thirty-day period. To the extent any Dispute is not settled by mediation as outlined above, then any Dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in force, and that the arbitration hearings shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts. The parties agree to (i) appoint an arbitrator who is knowledgeable in employment and human resource matters and, to the extent possible, the industry in which the Company operates, and instruct the arbitrator to follow substantive rules of law; (ii) require the testimony to be transcribed; and (iii) require the award to be accompanied by findings of act and a statement of reasons for the decision. The arbitrator shall have the authority to permit discovery, to the extent deemed appropriate by the arbitrator, upon request of a party, but such discovery process shall continue for no more than thirty (30) days. The arbitrator shall have no power or authority to add to or detract from the written agreement of the parties. If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) days after demand by either of them, either or both parties may request the American Arbitration Association name a panel of five (5) arbitrators. The Company shall strike the names of two (2) off this list, the Executive shall also strike two (2) names, and the remaining name shall be the arbitrator. The parties shall stipulate that arbitration shall be completed within sixty (60) days. All costs and expenses, including attorneys’ a...  dispute-resolution\n",

Should the Agreed Use be amended to accommodate a material change in the business of Lessee or to accommodate a sublessee or assignee, Lessor shall have the right to increase the Security Deposit to the extent necessary, in Lessor’s reasonable judgment, to account for any increased wear and tear that the Premises may suffer as a result thereof. If a change in control of Lessee occurs during this Lease and following such change the financial condition of Lessee is, in Lessor’s reasonable judgment, significantly reduced, Lessee shall deposit such additional monies with Lessor as shall be sufficient to cause the Security Deposit to be at a commercially reasonable level based on such change in financial condition. Lessor shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general accounts. Within 14 days after the expiration or termination of this Lease, if Lessor elects to apply the Security Deposit only to unpaid Rent, and otherwise within 30 days after the Premises have been vacated pursuant to Paragraph 7.4(c) below, Lessor shall return that portion of the Security Deposit not used or applied by Lessor.

For the purposes of the fulfillment, in whole or in part, of its standards or criteria for the authorization, licensing or certification of services suppliers, and subject to the requirements of paragraph 3, a Party may recognize the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted in the other Party or a non-Party. Such recognition, which may be achieved through harmonization or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement with the other Party or a non-Party concerned or may be accorded autonomously. 2. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to in paragraph 1, whether existing or future, shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party, if the other Party is interested, to negotiate its accession to such an agreement or arrangement or to negotiate comparable ones with it. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to demonstrate that education, experience, licences or certifications obtained or requirements met in that other Party's territory should be recognized. 3. A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a means of discrimination between countries in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorization, licensing or certification of services suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services. 4. Each Party should encourage the relevant bodies in its respective territory to conduct future negotiations for developing mutually acceptable standards and criteria for licensing, temporary licensing and certification of professional services suppliers.  recognition\n",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subscriber acknowledges and understands the Securities are subject to transfer restrictions as described in Section 8 hereof. Subscriber agrees that if any transfer of its Securities or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition precedent to any such transfer, Subscriber may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company with respect to such transfer. Absent registration or another available exemption from registration, Subscriber agrees it will not resell the Securities (unless otherwise permitted pursuant to the Insider Letter, as described in the Registration Statement). Subscriber further acknowledges that because the Company is a shell company, Rule 144 may not be available to Subscriber for the resale of the Securities until the one year anniversary following consummation of the initial Business Combination of the Company, despite technical compliance with the requirements of Rule 144 and the release or waiver of any contractual transfer restrictions.  restrictions-on-transfer\n",

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wis...    preamble\n",

The purchase price for the Mortgage Loans (the \"Purchase Price\") shall be the percentage of par as stated in the Commitment Letter, multiplied by the aggregate principal balance, as of the Cut-off Date, of the Mortgage Loans listed on the related Mortgage Loan Schedule, after application of scheduled payments of principal due on or before the Cut-off Date whether or not collected. The Purchase Price may be adjusted as stated in the Commitment Letter. In addition to the Purchase Price as described above, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, at closing, accrued interest on the initial principal amount of the Mortgage Loans at the weighted average Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate from the Cut-off Date through the day prior to the Closing Date, inclusive. The Purchaser shall be entitled to (1) all scheduled principal due after the Cut-off Date, (2) all other recoveries of principal collected after the Cut-off Date (provided, however, that all scheduled payments of principal due on or before the Cut-off Date and collected by the Seller after the Cut-off Date shall belong to the Seller), and (3) all payments of interest on the Mortgage Loans at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate (minus that portion of any such payment which is allocable to the period prior to the Cut-off Date). The principal balance of each Mortgage Loan as of the Cut-off Date is determined after application of payments of principal due on or before the Cut-off Date whether or not collected. Therefore, payments of scheduled principal and interest prepaid for a Due Date beyond the Cut-off Date shall not be applied to the principal balance as of the Cut-off Date. Such prepaid amounts (minus interest at the Servicing Fee Rate) shall be the property of the Purchaser. The Seller shall deposit any such prepaid amounts into the Custodial Account, which account is established for the benefit of the Purchaser for subsequent remittance by the Seller to the Purchaser.  purchase-price\n",
